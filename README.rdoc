== Introduction

This is a javascript gallery which includes two seperate things:
 
* The gallery interface which is purely JS
* Script which feeds images to the gallery
    
The feeder script can fetch images from anywhere - from local files to
online image storage like Flicker.

== Usage

Just see the example in index.php :)
